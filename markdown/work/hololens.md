description: "I began my career at Microsoft as a software engineer on the HoloLens Systems, sensors, and firmware team. I've had the pleasure to contribute to HoloLens 2 and the IVAS project. My work was primarily on sensor integration, drivers, and runtime for the HPU which is a custom ASIC for the device."
