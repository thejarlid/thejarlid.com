description: "Following my attempt at developing a rudimentary video stabilizer for my Computer Vision course's final project I wanted to explore industry approaches. Looking into the topic I found a research paper by Google titled Auto Directed Video Stabilization with Robust L1 Optimal Camera Paths. This is my implementation of methods presented in the paper. To read more about this I have also written a blog post on it."
