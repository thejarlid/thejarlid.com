description: "This is my implementation of the xv6 POSIX-like kernel from CSE 451 OS - Fall 2017. xv6 is a modern reimplementation of Sixth Edition Unix. This was the first time this project (titled xk in the course material). This project sparked my love for operating systems and working at the systems level. I later went on to TA the course and build up support and infrastructure for this codebase."
