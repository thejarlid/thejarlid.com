description: "Orion is Meta's first AR Glasses and the most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made. They are true tetherless glasses with large holographic displays that blends the digital physical worlds to bring a new dimension to computing possibilities, unconstrained by the limits of a smartphone screen. I have been fortunate enough to be part of the team, having worked on both the custom CV/ML silicon firmware and more recently the Eye Tracking team. Orion is by far one of the toughest and most fun projects I've gotten to work on and show the world."
