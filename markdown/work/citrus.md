This is the first large scale project I ever undertook. Having never programmed before I wanted to build an iOS app so with my best friend in high school we both create Citrus which went on to eventually become featured on the Apple App Store as Best New App in Germany, Sweden, and Austria. This was my first exposure to iOS development and sparked my love for the development ecosystem.
