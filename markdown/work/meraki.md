description: "My quarantine side-project when covid began was to productize the todo list I had built for myself during college. It was an exploration of novel UI and UX methods to elicit feelings of calmness, relaxation, and clarity when approaching the mental taxation task management. Developed for iOS first, following the release I'm working to make this a cross platform experience."
