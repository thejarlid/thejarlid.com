description: This is a conversational agent to talk to your saved google maps list. I wanted a way to ask for recommendations based on the saved lists I personally have. Only after exhausting my list or in areas of weak recs do I leverage a larger pool of data. This is a full stack project in NextJS/React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and LangChain for the agent orchestration. Indexing is done across both a SQL DB and VectorDB. Built originally to just query my lists, this project will eventually allow users to add their own lists.
