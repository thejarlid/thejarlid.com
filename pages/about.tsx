          I&apos;m a caffeine based lifeform ☕️ currently working as a software engineer at Meta Reality Labs on the Eye Tracking Computer Vision and ML Algorithms team.
          You can read about my prior experience at Instagram and Microsoft <a style={{fontWeight:"400"}} href="/dilraj-devgun-resume.pdf">here</a> . Sometimes I teach; 
          throughout college I was a TA for the intro progamming course and later the upper division OS course. Post-grad I volunteer occasionally to TA for Stanford&apos;s 
          Code In Place program. I would not be here without the patience of those who taught me and I feel as if its only right to pass it on. What started as a creative 
          hobby of designing and developing iOS apps with my best friend grew into a technical interest and career pursuit. In general I love learning (and teaching and 
          I use code as my medium to express my creativity.

          In my free time I love playing soccer, tennis, boxing, reading, and cooking. You can find me enjoying a nice cup of coffee somewhere or seeking out warm weather
          and a beach to go for a surf.
